## üîç Console Logs to Check

Open browser dev tools and check the console for:

1. **Email Generation Logs:**
   ```
   üìß Invitation Email Generated:
   To: test.employee@example.com
   Subject: You're invited to join ReceiptShield
   Invitation URL: http://localhost:3000/accept-invitation?token=...
   ‚úÖ Invitation email sent successfully
   ```

2. **Welcome Email Logs:**
   ```
   üìß Welcome Email Generated for: test.employee@example.com
   Subject: Welcome to ReceiptShield!
   ‚úÖ Welcome email sent successfully
   ```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid invitation link"
**Solution:** Check that the token in the URL matches what's in the database

### Issue: "Failed to create account"
**Solution:** Check Firebase permissions and ensure the user doesn't already exist

### Issue: Invitation dialog doesn't open
**Solution:** Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: Email not sending
**Solution:** Check the email service configuration in `src/lib/email-service.ts`

## üìä Database Verification

Check your Firebase Firestore for:

1. **Invitations Collection:**
   - New documents created with invitation data
   - Status updates (pending ‚Üí accepted)
   - Proper expiry dates set

2. **Users Collection:**
   - New user documents created
   - Correct role and supervisor assignments
   - Status set to "active"

## üéØ Success Criteria

The invitation system is working correctly if:

- ‚úÖ Admin can send invitations for all roles
- ‚úÖ Invitations appear in management table
- ‚úÖ Email templates are generated (logged in console)
- ‚úÖ Invitation links work and show correct information
- ‚úÖ Users can create accounts through invitation links
- ‚úÖ New users can log in with created accounts
- ‚úÖ Invitation status updates correctly
- ‚úÖ Duplicate invitations are prevented
- ‚úÖ Expired invitations are handled properly

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once testing is complete:

1. **Configure Email Service**: Set up real email provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
2. **Customize Templates**: Update email templates with your company branding
3. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure email settings in production
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track invitation acceptance rates and user onboarding

## üìù Test Data

Use these test emails for consistent testing:
- `test.employee@example.com` - Employee role
- `test.manager@example.com` - Manager role  
- `test.admin@example.com` - Admin role

Remember to clean up test data after testing is complete!
