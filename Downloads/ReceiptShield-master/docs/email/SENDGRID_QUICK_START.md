## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Verify Your Sender Email in SendGrid**

**Before sending emails, you MUST verify your sender email address in SendGrid:**

1. Go to SendGrid: [https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders)
2. Click **"Create New Sender"**
3. Use **aqallaf76@gmail.com** as the sender email
4. Check your Gmail inbox for the verification link
5. Click the verification link to confirm

**❌ Emails will NOT send until you verify the sender email!**

## 📋 **Next Steps**

### 1. **Verify Your Sender Email** (Required - 2 minutes)
   - See the important section above ☝️
   - This is **mandatory** or emails won't send

### 2. **Test Locally** (Optional but recommended)
   - Add SendGrid config to your `.env.local`:
     ```bash
     SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
     SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=aqallaf76@gmail.com
     ```
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Go to Admin Dashboard → Invite User
   - Send a test invitation
   - Check if email is received

### 3. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   # Deploy your updated code
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   
   # Or if using Firebase App Hosting
   # Just push to your main branch (auto-deploys)
   ```

### 4. **Test in Production**
   - Send a test invitation from production
   - Check SendGrid Activity dashboard
   - Verify email delivery

### 5. **Monitor SendGrid Activity**
   - Go to: [https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity](https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity)
   - Check emails are being delivered
   - Monitor your daily limit (100 emails/day)

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: Emails not sending (403 Forbidden)
**Solution**: Verify your sender email in SendGrid (see Important section above)

### Issue: "Unauthorized" error
**Solution**: Check that the API key is correct in Firebase secrets

### Issue: Emails go to spam
**Solution**: 
1. Use Domain Authentication instead of Single Sender
2. Warm up your sender reputation (start with small volumes)
3. Ensure email content doesn't trigger spam filters

### Issue: Daily limit exceeded
**Solution**: Wait 24 hours (resets at midnight UTC) or upgrade to paid plan
