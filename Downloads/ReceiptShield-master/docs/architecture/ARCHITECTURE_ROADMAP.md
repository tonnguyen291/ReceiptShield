---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Now → 30 Days) 🚨 **CRITICAL**

### Goal: Make System Production-Ready

```
Current State: MVP with gaps
Target State: Secure, monitored, backed up
```

### Critical Initiatives:

#### 1. Deploy ML Fraud Detection (P0)
**Problem:** ML service is currently mocked  
**Impact:** No real fraud detection  
**Solution:** Deploy Python ML service to Cloud Run  
**Effort:** 2 weeks  
**Cost:** $200/month runtime  

```python
# Deploy fraud detection as microservice
ml/
├── serve/
│   ├── main.py           # Flask/FastAPI service
│   ├── Dockerfile        # Container config
│   └── requirements.txt
└── deploy.sh             # Deployment script
```

#### 2. Implement Security Hardening (P0)
**Gaps:**
- ❌ No rate limiting
- ❌ Missing input validation
- ❌ No API authentication middleware

**Solutions:**
```typescript
// Rate limiting
import { rateLimit } from '@/lib/rate-limiter';

// Input validation
import { z } from 'zod';

// Auth middleware
import { withAuth } from '@/lib/api-middleware';
```

**Effort:** 1 week  
**Cost:** $50/month (Upstash Redis)

#### 3. Set Up Observability (P0)
**Tools:** Sentry + OpenTelemetry + Pino logging  
**Effort:** 3 days  
**Cost:** $200/month

#### 4. Configure Automated Backups (P0)
**Frequency:** Daily Firestore exports  
**Retention:** 30 days hot, 1 year cold  
**Effort:** 2 days  
**Cost:** $100/month storage

### Phase 1 Deliverables:
- ✅ ML fraud detection live
- ✅ API security hardened
- ✅ Full observability stack
- ✅ Disaster recovery capability
- ✅ 99.9% uptime target

---

## Phase 2: Performance (30 → 90 Days) ⚡

### Goal: Optimize for Speed & Reliability

```
Current Performance: 4s page load, 1.5s API
Target Performance: 2s page load, 500ms API
```

### Performance Initiatives:

#### 1. Implement Caching Strategy
**Layers:**
- Browser (React Query)
- Server (Upstash Redis)
- CDN (Cloudflare/Vercel)

**Expected Improvement:**
- 60% reduction in database reads
- 50% faster page loads
- $800/month cost savings

#### 2. Database Optimization
**Actions:**
- Create composite indexes
- Implement pagination
- Add read replicas
- Query result caching

**Tools:**
```bash
# Create indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# Monitor performance
npm run firestore:analyze
```

#### 3. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
**Optimize Bundle:**
- Current: ~2.5MB JavaScript
- Target: ~800KB initial load
- Strategy: Dynamic imports, route-based splitting

#### 4. Background Processing
**Move to Async:**
- OCR processing
- Fraud analysis
- Email sending
- Report generation

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Queue jobs with Cloud Tasks
import { CloudTasksClient } from '@google-cloud/tasks';

export async function queueOCRJob(receiptId: string) {
  await tasks.createTask({
    // ... task config
  });
}
```

### Phase 2 Deliverables:
- ✅ 2s page load time (P95)
- ✅ 500ms API response (P95)
- ✅ 80% cache hit rate
- ✅ 40% cost reduction

---

## Phase 3: Scale (3 → 6 Months) 📈

### Goal: Prepare for 100K Users

```
Current Capacity: ~10K users
Target Capacity: 100K users
```

### Scaling Initiatives:

#### 1. Microservices Architecture
**Extract Services:**
```
Monolith → Microservices
├── Receipt Service (Node.js)
├── Auth Service (Firebase)
├── ML Service (Python)
├── Analytics Service (BigQuery)
└── Notification Service (SendGrid/Twilio)
```

#### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
**Implement Pub/Sub:**
```typescript
// Receipt uploaded → Event
await pubsub.publish('receipt.uploaded', {
  receiptId,
  userId,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// Multiple subscribers
- OCR processor
- Fraud detector
- Notification service
- Analytics pipeline
```

#### 3. Multi-Region Deployment
**Regions:**
- Primary: us-central1 (Iowa)
- Secondary: europe-west1 (Belgium)
- Tertiary: asia-east1 (Taiwan)

**Latency Targets:**
- US: < 50ms
- Europe: < 100ms
- Asia: < 150ms

#### 4. Data Partitioning
**Strategy:**
```
Users 0-100K    → Firestore Instance 1
Users 100K-200K → Firestore Instance 2
...
```

### Phase 3 Deliverables:
- ✅ 100K user capacity
- ✅ Multi-region deployment
- ✅ Event-driven architecture
- ✅ 99.95% uptime SLA
