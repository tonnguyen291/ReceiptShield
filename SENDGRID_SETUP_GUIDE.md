# SendGrid Setup Guide for ReceiptShield

This guide will help you set up SendGrid for sending invitation emails in your ReceiptShield application. SendGrid is **recommended for production** as it's more reliable than Gmail SMTP and works better with Firebase App Hosting.

## üéØ **Why SendGrid?**

‚úÖ **More Reliable**: HTTPS API instead of SMTP (which Firebase App Hosting may block)  
‚úÖ **Better for Production**: Designed for transactional emails  
‚úÖ **Free Tier**: 100 emails/day (same as Gmail)  
‚úÖ **No SMTP Issues**: Works with all hosting platforms including Firebase  
‚úÖ **Better Deliverability**: Higher chance of emails landing in inbox

## üìß **Step 1: Create a SendGrid Account**

1. Go to [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Click **"Start for Free"** or **"Sign Up"**
3. Fill in your information:
   - Email address
   - Password
   - Company name (or personal name)
4. Verify your email address (check your inbox for verification link)
5. Complete the onboarding questionnaire

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 100 emails per day (forever free)
- No credit card required

---

## üîë **Step 2: Create an API Key**

1. Once logged in, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys** (in the left sidebar)
   - Direct link: [https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys)

2. Click **"Create API Key"**

3. Configure your API key:
   - **API Key Name**: `ReceiptShield Production` (or any descriptive name)
   - **API Key Permissions**: Select **"Full Access"** (or minimum **"Mail Send"**)

4. Click **"Create & View"**

5. **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Copy the API key immediately!
   - It looks like: `SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy`
   - You won't be able to see it again after closing the dialog
   - Save it securely (you'll need it for Step 4)

---

## ‚úâÔ∏è **Step 3: Verify Your Sender Email**

SendGrid requires you to verify the email address you'll send from. There are two options:

### Option A: Single Sender Verification (Easier - Recommended for Getting Started)

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication** ‚Üí **Single Sender Verification**
   - Direct link: [https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders)

2. Click **"Create New Sender"**

3. Fill in the form:
   - **From Name**: `ReceiptShield` (or your company name)
   - **From Email Address**: `aqallaf76@gmail.com` (or your preferred email)
   - **Reply To**: Same as from email (or a different one if you prefer)
   - **Company Address**: Your address
   - **Nickname**: `ReceiptShield Main` (internal reference)

4. Click **"Create"**

5. **Check your email** for a verification link from SendGrid
   - Click the verification link to confirm

6. ‚úÖ Once verified, you can use this email as your sender address!

### Option B: Domain Authentication (Better for Production)

If you own a domain (like `receiptshield.com`), you can authenticate the entire domain:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication** ‚Üí **Domain Authentication**
2. Follow the wizard to add DNS records to your domain
3. This allows you to send from any email on your domain (e.g., `noreply@receiptshield.com`)

**Note**: For now, use Option A (Single Sender Verification) to get started quickly.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Step 4: Configure Environment Variables**

### For Local Development (.env.local):

Create or update your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=aqallaf76@gmail.com

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Note**: Replace with your actual API key and verified email from Steps 2 and 3.

### For Production (Firebase App Hosting):

The API key has already been set as a secret. To verify or update:

```bash
# Check if the secret exists
firebase apphosting:secrets:list --project recieptshield

# If you need to update it
firebase apphosting:secrets:set SENDGRID_API_KEY --project recieptshield
```

The sender email is configured in `apphosting.production.yaml`:
```yaml
- variable: SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL
  value: aqallaf76@gmail.com
```

**‚úÖ Already Configured**: The production environment has been set up with:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` (secret): Your API key
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`: aqallaf76@gmail.com

## üß™ **Step 5: Test SendGrid Integration**

### Test Locally:

1. Make sure your `.env.local` has the SendGrid variables
2. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Go to the Admin Dashboard ‚Üí User Management
4. Click **"Invite User"**
5. Fill in the invitation form and send
6. Check the recipient's email inbox

### Test in Production:

After deploying:
1. Go to your production site
2. Send a test invitation
3. Check SendGrid Activity:
   - Go to **Activity** in SendGrid dashboard
   - You should see the email in the activity log
   - Check if it was delivered, opened, etc.

---

## üìä **Step 6: Monitor Email Activity**

SendGrid provides detailed analytics:

1. Go to **Activity** in SendGrid dashboard
   - Direct link: [https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity](https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity)

2. You can see:
   - ‚úâÔ∏è Emails sent
   - ‚úÖ Delivered
   - üìñ Opened
   - üñ±Ô∏è Clicked
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Bounced
   - üö´ Spam reports

3. **Daily Limit Tracking**:
   - SendGrid automatically tracks your usage
   - You get 100 emails/day on the free tier
   - Resets at midnight UTC

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### Security Best Practices:
- ‚úÖ **Never commit** `.env.local` to Git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- ‚úÖ **Keep your API key secret** - treat it like a password
- ‚úÖ **Rotate API keys** periodically for security
- ‚úÖ **Use different keys** for development and production

### SendGrid Limits (Free Tier):
- **100 emails per day** (resets at midnight UTC)
- **Unlimited contacts**
- **Email validation** included
- **Email API access**

### Email Best Practices:
- ‚úÖ Always use verified sender emails

- ‚úÖ Monitor your sender reputation in SendGrid
- ‚úÖ Keep bounce rates low (< 5%)
- ‚úÖ Avoid spam trigger words

---

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### "Unauthorized" Error:

**Solution**: 
1. Check that `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Verify the API key in SendGrid dashboard

### Daily Limit Exceeded:
